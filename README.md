What is Signify?
Empowering Hearing-Impaired Children with AI-Enhanced, Interactive E-Learning

Signify is a research-driven platform combining Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing to make learning accessible, interactive, and effective for children with hearing impairments aged 4 to 12. Our solution integrates real-time ASL recognition, educational content translation, and an AI-powered assistant to foster confident, inclusive education.

# Introduction
Our project focuses on developing Signify, an AI-enhanced e-learning platform designed to improve educational accessibility for hearing-impaired children aged 4–12. The platform integrates augmented reality, machine learning, and natural language processing to provide interactive American Sign Language (ASL) learning, real-time content translation, and an AI assistant for personalized support.

Signify aims to bridge communication barriers by enabling real-time ASL recognition, video captioning, and adaptive learning recommendations to empower hearing-impaired learners

# Research Gap
Current e-learning platforms largely lack:

Real-time sign language translation integrated with educational content.
Interactive and immersive ASL learning modules with immediate feedback.
Emotional and sentiment analysis to personalize and adapt the learning experience.
A unified system combining ASL practice, translation, and AI assistance seamlessly.
Our project addresses these gaps by combining these features into a single cohesive platform, targeting improved learning outcomes and accessibility.
